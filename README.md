My-LinkedIn-Page
================

My first Ruby on Rails and API experiment

Idea:
-----
"My LinkedIn Page" collects your LinkedIn data, and formats it from JSON to HTML. Hopefully, it will later save the information to a database and provide a link where anyone can access your page without authentication.

Todo:
-----
* Format the JSON data from the LinkedIn API into the format that JSON Resume uses, so that https://jsonresume.org can be used for generating the HTML page.

Of course you can contribute to the project if you think it's a nice idea. You're also welcome to provide feedback to marcus@marcusnygren.se.
